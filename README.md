### Flask application for Flamingo
Music is a part of each and every person’s life. Whether you enjoy it or
not, it somehow finds its way everywhere. People use Instagram every
day for multiple reasons: to find new clothes, see what their friends are
doing, or sometimes share music. What if there was a platform like
Instagram tailored to people who want to post what they are listening to at
the moment and people could interact. If you like someone’s taste of
music, you can ‘like’ the song or ‘comment’ on what you like about it. On
top of liking and commenting, what if the user could add it to the # 1
streaming platform in the United States, Spotify. Flamingo will integrate with the Spotify API so people can automatically add
songs to their very own playlists.
